## Instructions

Final project from Udacity's Object oriented JavaScript course. The project is a Frogger clone made with basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/15/view) for self-checking your submission.

Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like `Player` and `Enemy`) or class prototype functions such as `Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions`. Also make sure that the keyword `this` is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. This is for the Pseudo classical instantiation pattern, code was refactor into ES6 instantiation pattern that utilizes the keywords class, constructor, this and new. 

Your **README.md** file should be updated with instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

## Project Specification

- [ ] The game functions correctly and runs error free.

- [x] Player can not move off screen

- [x] Vehicles cross the screen

- [x] Vehicle-player collisions happen logically (not too early or too late)

- [x] Vehicle-player collision resets the game

- [x] Something happens when player wins

- [x] Game objects (player and vehicles) are implemented using JavaScript object-oriented programming features. ES6 instantiation pattern was used.

- [x] A README file is included detailing all steps required to successfully run the application.

- [ ] Comments are present and effectively explain longer code procedures. As a rule of thumb: describe what all custom functions and object methods do.

- [x] Code is formatted with consistent, logical, and easy-to-read formatting.

## How to Run

In order to be able to test the game simply download repository into your machine and open the file index.html in your favorite internet browser.

## How to Play

Reach the top of the screen in order to accumulate as much points as possible.

Key bindings:

    - Up: move up.

    - Right: move right.

    - Down: move down.

    - Left: move left.

    - 1: change player sprite.

    - 2: change player sprite.

    - 3: change player sprite.

    - F5: refresh.

## Notes

All graphics used and most of the code are products of my own design.
